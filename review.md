Code layout was simple and easy to follow and had a purpose that it fulfilled. pip install went smoothly fine and the imported libraries worked.

code is very clear and variable names make them easy to understand. doesn't use anything very complicated but i feel like the input of some of the methods could be more accepting. overall 3.
